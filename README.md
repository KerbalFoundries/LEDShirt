A (bad) fork of NigthDriverStrip

This isn't even a fork of Dave's wonderful NigthDriverStrip project - github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/NightDriverStrip - hacked about to run some wearables. I can't even remember what I did, but Dave: I'm sorry for what I did to your code. In my defence: it works.

This isn't even the latest version, because lazy.
